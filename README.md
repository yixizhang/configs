## What

**Configs are code**

I hope this configs can one day turn into `nix` packages or something more deterministic, OS agnostic, and don't become invalid at any time.
 
## Install

 ```
 tmux
 git clone https://github.com/yixizhang/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
 cd ~/.dotfiles && sh ./install.sh
 ```
